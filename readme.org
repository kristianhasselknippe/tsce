Typescript to Elisp compiler

Just started, so it is very hacky and crude atm.

** Missing features
- Enums
- Async/await
- Proper module resolution

** Why?
I wanted to write more emacs packages, but I hate working without static type checking. Typescript has a flexible enough type system that i could be viable as a compiler frontend, and the typescript compiler API is very accessible.
