Typescript to Elisp compiler

** Missing features

- Classes
- Async/await
- NPM package support
- A bunch of smaller things
- Documentation

** Why?
I wanted to write more emacs packages, but I hate working without static type checking. Typescript has a flexible enough type system that it could be viable as a compiler frontend, and the typescript compiler API is very accessible.

** Sorry about the mess

This is currently a very hack'n slash thing until i figure out a proper architecture.
